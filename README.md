# Hello and Welcome to my GitHub profile.


all of the  displayed repos are my personal <sup>superrr fun</sup> projects.

- I primarily focus on WordPress, but I'm also branching out into other areas.

- Currently, I'm refining my approach to creating Custom Blocks for WordPress.





<h3>Allow me to present a couple of my projects:</h3>
   <section dir='auto'>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td width='50%' valign='top'>
            <h4>WebGrid.Dev Projects Gallery Slider</h4>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoganDuran/wgd-projects-gallery-block/refs/heads/main/assets/Screenshot-1.jpg" alt="Gif of Southern Paiute Dictionary" style="max-width: 100%;" width="100%"">

              <strong style="max-width: 50%;" width="50%">Custom Image Gallery Block with Sliding Zoom-In Effect</strong> 
            <br>
               This block is perfect for showcasing image collections such as photography portfolios, product images, travel photos, or any visual content that benefits from added depth and movement.
