### Hello World 

# Welcome to my GitHub profile, all displayed repos are my personal fun projects.


- ðŸ”­ I'm currently doing mostly WordPress work, but also branching out into different areas, in particular working on improving my PHP skills.

- âš¡ Fun fact: the first bit of "programming" I did was back in the MySpace days, I started by customizing the profile to my liking, changing the background image the color of the font, and the overall color scheme of the website.
