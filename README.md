### Hello World 

Welcome to my GitHub profile, all of the displayed repos are my personal projects.


- ðŸ”­ I'm currently doing mostly WordPress work, although I'm expanding in all sorts of directions
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing my attention towards PHP in general.

- âš¡ Fun fact: the first bit of "programming" I did was back in the MySpace days, I started by customizing the profile to my liking, changing the background image the color of the font, and the overall color scheme of the website.
